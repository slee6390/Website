                <h2>Hi there, I'm Seo Yeon (Sunny) Lee.</h2>
                By day, I serve as a research assistant, 
                where I'm deeply committed to the art of effective communication and the excitement of creative problem-solving.
                But that's just part of my journey. 
                I'm on an exploration to unearth the true crux of my passions and potential. 
                I'm on a quest to find the intersection of my diverse interests, 
                where they come together to unveil my fullest capabilities.
                <br><br>
                Care to join me on this incredible journey? Let's take a glimpse into the chapters of my story so far.
